# leaflet-challenge

Welcome back for this weeks Leaflet Challenge! 

No analysis was done during this challenge so just have fun running the index.html file found in the main page! I had to add some background details into the css file so take a peak at that. Otherwise you just have my logic js file to peruse. 

All code was written by me using the starter code, class materials, and the class ai tool for troubleshooting. 

Let me know if you have any questions or any issues with this!
Thank you!
